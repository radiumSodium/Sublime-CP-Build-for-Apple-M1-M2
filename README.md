# Sublime-CP-Build-for-Apple-M1-M2
This will fix the g++ compilation error on Apple silicon processor

<p>I used to love sublime text as my code editor for Competitive Programming. Specially because I has special build system which helped me taking Input from the `inputf.in` file and showing output to `output.f` file. and the compilation was easy just a shortcut away `shift + command + B` . After buying my new Apple M1 Pro the compilation of C++ file with g++ compiler was not working properly. I kind of left coding C++ on M1 pro. Now I have the solution to this and I thought I should share with all.</p>
